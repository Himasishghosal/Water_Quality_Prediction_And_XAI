# MA5755-Water_Quality_Prediction_And_XAI
Enhancing Water Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning and Explainable AI: A Transparent Approach to Water Quality Index (WQI) Prediction and Interpretation.

In this (Data Visualization and Analysis
in R/Python/SQL
(MA5755) Course Project), we aim to improve water quality prediction using a combination of ML models and explainable AI methods. We begin with baseline models such as: Logistic Regression and progressively explore more sophisticated techniques like SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). Among these, MLP achieved the highest accuracy at ~ 98%. To address interpretability, we employ SHAP and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations). SHAP helps quantify the contribution of each feature to the model's prediction, offering a unified and consistent explanation for complex outputs. LIME, on the other hand, builds local surrogate models to provide insight into specific predictions. Together, these XAI tools help bridge the gap between accuracy and transparency, allowing both technical experts and decision-makers to understand and trust the predictions.
